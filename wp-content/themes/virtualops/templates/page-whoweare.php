                <h2> Founderâ€™s Message</h2>
                <p>I founded Virtual Ops LLP in 2017, after more than 20 years of global experience in
                    Outsourcing/Offshoring Industry. While doing business development for a leading
                    Outsourcing/Offshoring firm in the US, we helped Fortune 500 companies
                    with outsourced customer support and back office operations. It was a win-win as we helped clients
                    reduce costs, improve operational efficiencies and resolve their customerâ€™s issues. As the eCommerce
                    Industry grew and evolved rapidly
                    since the last decade, customer issues kept growing as well. A majority of the issues were due to
                    product returns/refunds/cart abandonment, which were a result of poor product data and listings,
                    more so for the small and mid-sized
                    companies which joined the ecommerce bandwagon. I realized a gap and opportunity to blend a
                    combination of technology and highly skilled human resources to help publish and manage accurate,
                    complete and consistent products. This
                    can benefit everyone - Online Retailers, Distributors and Manufacturers have reduced customer
                    issues, increased revenues and enhanced brand reputation while Customers can have a delightful
                    experience with online shopping.</p>
                <p>In the last 5 years, we have built a team of quality conscious, tech savvy product enthusiasts, who
                    love to help our clients succeed as well as customers have a better experience. We have a long way
                    to go. Our goal is to stay in forefront
                    of digital commerce developments and build expertise that helps us be the preferred partner for
                    product data management, and build long term partnerships with clients. If you would like to discuss
                    how we can grow together, please
                    feel free to contact us.
