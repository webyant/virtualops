                    <h2> Founder’s Message</h2>
                    <p>I founded Virtual Ops LLP in 2017, after more than 20 years of global experience in Outsourcing/Offshoring Industry. While doing business development for a leading Outsourcing/Offshoring firm in the US, we helped Fortune 500 companies
                        with outsourced customer support and back office operations. It was a win-win as we helped clients reduce costs, improve operational efficiencies and resolve their customer’s issues. As the eCommerce Industry grew and evolved rapidly
                        since the last decade, customer issues kept growing as well. A majority of the issues were due to product returns/refunds/cart abandonment, which were a result of poor product data and listings, more so for the small and mid-sized
                        companies which joined the ecommerce bandwagon. I realized a gap and opportunity to blend a combination of technology and highly skilled human resources to help publish and manage accurate, complete and consistent products. This
                        can benefit everyone - Online Retailers, Distributors and Manufacturers have reduced customer issues, increased revenues and enhanced brand reputation while Customers can have a delightful experience with online shopping.</p>
                    <p>In the last 5 years, we have built a team of quality conscious, tech savvy product enthusiasts, who love to help our clients succeed as well as customers have a better experience. We have a long way to go. Our goal is to stay in forefront
                        of digital commerce developments and build expertise that helps us be the preferred partner for product data management, and build long term partnerships with clients. If you would like to discuss how we can grow together, please
                        feel free to contact us.
